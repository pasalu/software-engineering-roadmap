# Getting Started

getting started might be daunting but there are plenty of resources and online communities to support and encourage your development

## Guide

* start learning the basics of programming
  * what is software, what is a program, how do we get from 1's and 0's to pictures, video games, zip files?
  * take courses, a good place to start are the [basics](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/Getting%20Started.md#courses)
    * ideally you need a class in data structures, algorithms, and a programming class
    * try coding data structures, algorithms, or experiment with the concepts yourself
