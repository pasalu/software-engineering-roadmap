## Cycle Detection

* tortoise and hare
  * tortoise pointer moves 1 at each step
  * hare moves 2 at each step
  * if they ever meet their is a cycle
  * you can also use this algorithm (with more steps) to find start of cycle and the length of the cycle
* applicable data structures

## General Common Issues

* space vs indexing speed vs sorting speed
