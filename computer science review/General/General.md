# General

## Administrative

* small informative variables
* comments in function definition, if, while, for, etc.
* pre/post conditions, loop invariant
* input/output types
* test null and all possible inputs (and outputs)
* initialize a variables you get from else where as null then get them (just in case thereâ€™s an issue getting them) and test if null

## Proving Code

* preconditions, postconditions, assertions, loop invariants
* connect algorithmic ideas to imperative programs
* proofs + contracts = correctness and safety of code
