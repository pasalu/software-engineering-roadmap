# Classification

## Classification by purpose

* each algorithm has a goal
* kind of purposes
  * Sorting a list

## Classification by implementation

* recursive or iterative
  * a recursive algorithm calls itself repeatedly until a certain condition matches
  * a iterative algorithm uses looping statements such as for loop, while loop or do-while loop
  * every recursive version has an iterative equivalent iterative, and vice versa
* logical or procedural
  * an algorithm may be viewed as controlled logical deduction
  * a logic component expresses the axioms which may be used in the computation 
  * a control component determines the way in which deduction is applied to the axioms
* serial or parallel
  * in serial algorithms, computers execute one instruction of an algorithm at a time
  * parallel algorithms take advantage of computer architectures to process several instructions at once
* deterministic or non-deterministic
  * deterministic algorithms solve the problem with a predefined process 
  * non-deterministic algorithm must perform guesses of best solution at each step through the use of heuristics

## Classification by design paradigm

* divide and conquer
* contraction (Reduction/transform and conquer)
* dynamic programming
* greedy method
  * similar to dynamic programming but solutions to subproblems do not have to be known at each stage
  * a "greedy" choice can be made of what looks the best solution for the moment
  * Kruskal
 * linear programming
* graphs
* the probabilistic and heuristic paradigm
  * probabilistic
    * those that make some choices randomly
  * genetic
    * attempt to find solutions to problems by mimicking biological evolutionary processes
    * a cycle of random mutations yielding successive generations of "solutions"
    * thus, they emulate reproduction and "survival of the fittest"
  * heuristic
    * whose general purpose is not to find an optimal solution, but an approximate solution where the time or resources to find a perfect solution are not practical
