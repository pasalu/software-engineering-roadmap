# Interview Prep

## Practice

* [pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/)
* [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)

## Interview Topics/Sections

* coding
* algorithm design and analysis
  * Big O notation
* [system design](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview)
  * system design isn't always covered but it's become more standard in SWE interviews and an important part of software development
* open-ended discussion
  * professional background and history
  * technical interests and passions

## Interview Criteria

* communication
  * ask clarifying questions
  * discuss design decisions and implementation trade-offs
* speed
  * practice coding quickly
  * get a working solution first
* quality
  * write clean/bug free code
  * iteratively fix bugs and optimize the solution
  
## Subject Matter

* [computer science review](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/computer%20science%20review/Computer%20Science%20Review.md)

## Advice and Tips

* spend a couple days (2-3) studying the subject matter and CS fundamentals
  * [data structures](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/computer%20science%20review/Data%20Structures/Data%20Structures.md), object-oriented design, and [algorithms](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/computer%20science%20review/Algorithms/Algorithms.md)
  * ex: [arrays](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/computer%20science%20review/Primitives/Arrays/Arrays.md), [(O)n](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/), binary trees, link list, integers, hash map, traversals, recursions, etc.
  * go back to your college textbooks
  * pick your favorite data structure and implement it
* spend a week or 2 practicing problems and practicing mock interviews
* line up interviews in rounds so you can pace yourself and improve
  * line up easier or companies your less interested in earlier so you can build momentum and confidence for the interviews you really care about
  * practice while applying then set interviews 2-3 weeks outs to study and get in the zone
* explore roles adjacent to software engineering
