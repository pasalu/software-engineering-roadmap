# Interview Prep

## Advice and Tips

* Spend a couple days (2-3) studying the subject matter and CS fundamentals
  * [data structures](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/Computer%20Science%20Review/Notes/Data%20Structures/Data%20Structures.md), object-oriented design, and [algorithms](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/Computer%20Science%20Review/Notes/Algorithms/Algorithms.md)
  * ex: [arrays](https://github.com/unboagable/software-engineering-roadmap/blob/master/Computer%20Science%20Review/Notes/Primitives/Arrays/Arrays.md), [(O)n](https://www.bigocheatsheet.com/), binary trees, link list, integers, hash map, traversals, recursions, etc.
  * go back to your college textbooks
  * pick your favorite data structure and implement it
* Spend a week or 2 practicing problems and practicing mock interviews
* Line up interviews in rounds so you can pace yourself and improve
  * line up easier or companies your less interested in earlier so you can build momentum and confidence for the interviews you really care about
  * practice while applying then set interviews 2-3 weeks outs to study and get in the zone

* [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/all/)

## Interview Topics/Sections

* Coding
* Algorithm Design and Analysis
  * Big O notation
* [System Design](https://github.com/checkcheckzz/system-design-interview)
  * system design isn't always covered but it's become more standard in SWE interviews and an important part of software development
* Open-Ended Discussion
  * professional background and history
  * technical interests and passions

## Interview Criteria

* Communication
  * ask clarifying questions
  * discuss design decisions and implementation trade-offs
* Speed
  * practice coding quickly
  * get a working solution first
* Quality
  * write clean/bug free code
  * iteratively fix bugs and optimize the solution
