Theory and Specification

# Principles

1. It must be simple, object-oriented, and familiar.
2. It must be robust and secure.
3. It must be architecture-neutral and portable.
4. It must execute with high performance.
5. It must be interpreted, threaded, and dynamic.

# Basic Definitions

* an object is a runtime entity and itâ€™s state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods
  * methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication
  * the Object class is the parent class of all the classes in java by default
* a class represents the set of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type
  * a class can contain fields and methods to describe the behavior of an object

# Access Modifiers

* public
  * any class can access
  * accessible by entire application
* private
  * only accessible within the class
* protected
  * allow the class itself to access them
  * classes inside of the same package to access them
  * subclasses of that class to access them
* package protected
  * default
  * the same class and any class in the same package has access
  * protected minus the subclass unless subclass is in package
* Static: Belongs to class not an instance of the class
