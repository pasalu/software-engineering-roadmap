# Combinatorics

## Factorial

* factorial (5\*4\*3\*2\*1=5!) 
* 0!=1

## r-s Principle

* 5 pairs of pants to go with 2 shirts 5*2 options
* ordered pair-pair of 'things' arranged in a certain order

## Permutations and combinations

* Permutations (care about order)
  * place n objects in k positions
  * ```math k = n!/(n-k)!```
* combinations (dont care about order)
  * divide by n! because compared to permutation n places(order) to place first choice, n-1 to place second...
  *  
\[
\Mycomb{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}={n \choose k}\quad
\]
